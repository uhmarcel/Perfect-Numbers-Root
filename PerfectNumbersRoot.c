  Description:  This program finds and displays perfect numbers in an
                specified range, then it finds their square root by
                applying the Babylonian algorithm for square roots.
                This implementation of the Babylonian method was based on
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_
                square_roots

        Input:  No input

       Output:  The program displays each perfect number, its corresponding
                factors, the expected square root result, and the computed
                value based on the Babylonian method.

      Process:  The program's steps are as follows
                1. Test number to see if its perfect number
                   - If not, increase number an repeat step 1.
                2. Display perfect number and factors.
                3. Display expected square root from sqrt().
                4. Display computed square root and iterations.

/**
 *  Function isPerfectNumber(int integer)
 *  Checks if an input integer is a perfect number. A perfect number is any
 *  number which the addition of its factors (excluding itself) result in the
 *  original number.
 *  (reference from http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectNumber.html)
 *  The algorithm takes advantage of factors being in pair, computing
 *  two values per iteration. Also, the loop navigates up to sqrt of
 *  the input, as it is the last number before checking the upper pairs
 *  of the factors which were already included.
 *  The algorithm also discards odd numbers, as it is unknown if they
 *  exist, and if they do, their expected value would be bigger than 10^1500,
 *  far out of the reach of this algorithm. This measure theoretically cuts
 *  execution time by half.
 *  (odd value reference from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number)
 *  @param number  Any integer to be checked.
 *  @return  TRUE(1) if the input is a perfect number, else FALSE (0).
